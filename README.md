# ðŸ§  Microscopic Neuro-Drilling Skills Evaluation

This repository contains the source code and usage instructions for the deep learning-based framework proposed in the research titled:

**"A Deep Learning Approach for Objective Evaluation of Microscopic Neuro-Drilling Craniotomy Skills"**

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

This work presents the **first well-annotated dataset** and a deep learning pipeline for **automated skill evaluation** of microscopic neuro-drilling, a critical component of neurosurgical training. The framework:
- Frames skill evaluation as a **rank estimation** task.
- Introduces a **geometric-order learning loss** to improve feature separability.
- Incorporates a **Unet-based segmentation module** to isolate the **region-of-interest (ROI)** for accurate assessment.
- Outperforms traditional regression/classification approaches and even human experts on multiple metrics.

## ðŸ§ª Methodology Summary

- **Data**: 435 final-task images scored on a 10-point Likert scale by neurosurgeons.
- **ROI Preprocessing**: Unet-based segmentation â†’ convex hull â†’ minimum area rectangle â†’ homography correction.
- **Modeling**: Feature embeddings trained with directional, distance, and center losses to ensure order-preserving representations.
- **Evaluation**:  
  - Metrics: MAE, MSE, Â±1 accuracy, Separability Index (SIÂ±1)
  - Baselines: Regression and classification with CNN/Transformer models
  - Result: Up to **95.17% Â±1 accuracy**, surpassing **human evaluator accuracy (87.74%)**
